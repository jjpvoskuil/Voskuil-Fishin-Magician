# Session Notes / Development Log

This file is a running record of what's been built, why, and what's still
open - meant to let a fresh Claude session (or a future you) get up to
speed quickly without re-deriving context. See `NEW_SESSION_PROMPT.md` for
the copy-paste prompt that points a new chat at this file.

## Project objective

A largemouth bass fishing forecast app for **Nolin River Lake, KY**, built
with Streamlit and hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud, code in
`jjpvoskuil/Voskuil-Fishin-Magician`. Core goals, from the original ask:

- 7-day forecast, 1-10 activity scale, built from weather + moon phase +
  solunar theory.
- For any day in the window: best times to fish, where on the lake to fish
  (contour map), and what to throw (lure, color, presentation) in each
  time segment.
- Click anywhere on a lake map for a location-specific setup recommendation.
- Log real trips; let the model learn from logged outcomes over time.
- Claude has direct read/write access to the GitHub repo - no copy/paste
  round-tripping through the user.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` in Streamlit secrets lets the deployed app itself commit
trip-log entries back to the repo (see `secrets.toml.example`).

## Development log (chronological)

1. **Initial build** - scoring engine, lure/color/technique rules, 8
   named lake spots on a Plotly map, trip logging + git-based persistence,
   5-page Streamlit app, pushed to GitHub.
2. **Contour map v1** - switched Plotly -> Folium/streamlit-folium
   specifically because Plotly's `Scattermapbox` click events only fire on
   plotted points, not arbitrary map background - Folium's `last_clicked`
   supports true click-anywhere. Added a MODELED depth surface (river-
   channel centerline + Gaussian cross-section) since no free bathymetric
   survey exists for Nolin Lake. Expanded the lure library to make sure
   crankbaits/jerkbaits/topwater show up broadly, not just their single
   best-case scenario. Added curated instructional video links per lure.
3. **Per-lure recommendation blocks** - restructured from flat "primary
   colors + also worth trying" lists into self-contained blocks (colors,
   trailer, depth, presentation, videos all bundled per lure), each with
   first-choice and second-choice sections.
4. **Lake Setup Options sidebar** - added shared surface-temp and
   sonar-fish-depth overrides so a real reading always beats the
   weather-only estimate; later simplified from checkbox-gated inputs to
   plain always-on number inputs per explicit user feedback, then made
   both fields mandatory (no more optional/skip semantics).
5. **Strike-up-biased depth targeting** - verified bass have upward-
   biased binocular vision, a blind spot below/behind, and an upward-
   hinging jaw, so they strike up more readily than down. Reaction/
   "column" lures now target 1-2 ft above a marked fish depth; bottom
   baits get count-down-to-depth guidance instead.
6. **Water clarity model** - Nolin normally runs greenish-brown (leaning
   brown); replaced a single 3-way clarity dropdown with a base stain
   color selector + independent "stirred up / muddy" checkbox (wind/rain
   can muddy any base color), resolved to one of 4 color-table keys.
7. **Thermocline depth** - initially a modeled, read-only estimate anchored
   to a real KDFWR data point (Kentucky Afield Outdoors, Lee McLellan, Jul
   2019: Nolin's thermocline runs ~15 ft in mid/late summer, grouped with
   Green/Barren/Rough River as similar mid-depth, clear hill-land
   reservoirs). Later converted to a direct sidebar input (matching the
   water-temp/fish-depth pattern) pre-filled from that seasonal model but
   always overridable - flags a caveat on the lure recommendation when a
   marked fish depth is below it (usually too oxygen-depleted to hold
   active bass).
8. **Forage selector** - added a multiselect (Gizzard Shad and Bluegill/
   Sunfish pre-checked as KDFWR-documented Nolin forage; Crawfish and
   Shiners/Minnows as add-ons) that nudges lure color/pattern choice and
   guarantees at least one forage-matched lure appears in the
   recommendation.
9. **Full sidebar wiring** - confirmed every Lake Setup Options value
   (clarity, structure, water temp, fish depth, thermocline, forage) feeds
   into every `recommend()` call on both pages that render lure
   recommendations (7-Day Forecast, Lake Map) - no page computes its own
   local copy of any of these anymore.
10. **Proprietary chart data - declined twice** - the user shared
    screenshots of a paid nautical charting app's contour/structure data
    (visible "BUY" watermark) and asked to use it for the map. Declined
    both times (including after the user clarified they'd personally
    purchased access) - a personal viewing license doesn't grant
    reproduction rights over the vendor's compiled survey data. Redirected
    to the angler's own recordable data instead.
11. **Garmin Quickdraw ingestion** - the user has a Garmin Striker 9sv that
    records Quickdraw Contours. Identified the open-source `qdc-converter`
    tool to export `.qdc`/`.qcc` files to a lon/lat/depth CSV. Built
    `core/survey_points.py` (loads/dedupes every CSV in `data/quickdraw/`)
    and a blending step in `core/bathymetry.py` (`_blend_real_survey_data`)
    that's inverse-distance-weighted, fully trusts real data at 0m, fades
    to the model by 50m, and can extend the map into un-modeled coves. This
    is the angler's own sonar data, not a scraped chart, so no copyright
    issue. Connected the user's local `~/Fishing` folder so they can drop
    new exports there over time; the workflow is: user drops a CSV, tells
    Claude, Claude copies it into `data/quickdraw/`, rebuilds/tests/pushes.

## Key design decisions & rationale

- **No proprietary chart scraping, ever** - bathymetry and thermocline
  defaults are built from verifiable public sources (USACE gauge, KY State
  Parks/GNIS, Census TIGER geocoding, KDFWR articles) or the angler's own
  recorded data, never from a commercial chart product, even one the user
  has personally paid to view.
- **Explainable, rule-based scoring/lure engine** - `core/scoring.py` and
  `core/lures.py` are intentionally not a black box; every weight/rule has
  an inline comment explaining the fishing-knowledge rationale.
- **Trip logging + lightweight self-calibration** - `core/calibration.py`
  compares catch-success rates between trips where a factor was present vs.
  absent, nudging default weights within a capped range only once enough
  samples exist per side (`MIN_SAMPLES_PER_SIDE=4`, `MAX_NUDGE_FRACTION=0.35`).
- **Git-based persistence, no external database** - trip logs and now
  Quickdraw survey CSVs are committed straight into the repo so Streamlit
  Cloud restarts don't lose data.
- **All "Lake Setup Options" are direct inputs, no optional/skip
  semantics** - per explicit user feedback, water temp, fish depth, and
  thermocline are always-active number inputs seeded with sensible
  defaults, not checkbox-gated or skippable.

## Known limitations / open items

- `core/bathymetry.py`'s `get_depth_at_ft()` selects a grid cell via
  `np.searchsorted` (nearest insertion point), not a true nearest-neighbor
  search - functionally fine once real Quickdraw data is dense along a
  traveled path, but worth tightening if single-point precision ever
  matters more.
- `data/quickdraw/` ships empty - no real survey data has been ingested
  yet. Next step is the user exporting their first Quickdraw trip and
  handing it over.
- `pages/3_Log_a_Trip.py` uses a flat water-clarity dropdown (defaulting
  to "Brown stained") rather than the base-stain + stirred-up toggle used
  on pages 1 & 2 - intentional, since it's recording a historical
  observation for one specific day, not a live/ongoing condition toggle.
- Forage and thermocline values used during a forecast/map session aren't
  yet fed back into `core/calibration.py`'s weight-nudging - only pressure
  trend, moon phase, cloud cover, and wind currently participate in
  calibration.
- No automated CI - verification is manual: `pytest tests/ -q`, an
  `AppTest`-based smoke test across all 5 pages (including sidebar
  interaction), and a fresh `git clone` + re-test before every push, done
  every round in this project.

## Operating notes

- GitHub repo: `jjpvoskuil/Voskuil-Fishin-Magician`, branch `main`.
- Claude pushes directly via `git push` over
  `https://x-access-token:<PAT>@github.com/jjpvoskuil/Voskuil-Fishin-Magician.git`
  - the PAT is only ever used inline in that URL inside shell commands,
  never echoed back in a chat response and never committed to any file.
  **A fresh PAT should be provided each session** rather than reusing one
  from a prior conversation.
- Streamlit secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) let the *deployed* app commit trip-log
  entries back on its own - separate from the PAT Claude uses locally
  during a dev session.
